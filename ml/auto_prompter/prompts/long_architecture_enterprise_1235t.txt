Your comprehensive architecture design should include:

1. HIGH-LEVEL SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE: Provide a detailed description of the overall system architecture including component relationships, data flow patterns, and integration points. Explain the rationale for architectural decisions and how they address scalability, reliability, and performance requirements.

2. MICROSERVICES BREAKDOWN: Define each microservice with specific responsibilities, APIs, data ownership, and interaction patterns. Include services for order management, risk assessment, market data processing, user management, portfolio management, settlement, and reporting.

3. DATA ARCHITECTURE AND DATABASE DESIGN: Design a comprehensive data strategy including transactional databases, analytical data stores, real-time streaming platforms, and data lakes. Address data partitioning, replication strategies, backup and recovery, and data governance policies.

4. MESSAGE QUEUING AND EVENT STREAMING: Design event-driven architecture using message queues, event streaming platforms, and pub/sub patterns. Address message ordering, deduplication, delivery guarantees, and handling of high-throughput scenarios.

5. SECURITY ARCHITECTURE: Implement comprehensive security including authentication, authorization, encryption at rest and in transit, network security, API security, and compliance monitoring. Address threat modeling and security incident response procedures.

6. CACHING AND PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION: Design multi-level caching strategies including application-level caching, distributed caching, CDN integration, and database query optimization. Address cache invalidation strategies and consistency models.

7. MONITORING AND OBSERVABILITY: Implement comprehensive monitoring including application performance monitoring, infrastructure monitoring, business metrics tracking, distributed tracing, and real-time alerting systems.

8. CLOUD-NATIVE DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY: Design containerized deployment using Kubernetes, service mesh architecture, infrastructure as code, and cloud-native services. Address multi-cloud strategies and vendor lock-in mitigation.

9. DISASTER RECOVERY AND BUSINESS CONTINUITY: Implement comprehensive disaster recovery including automated failover, data replication across regions, backup strategies, and business continuity procedures with defined RPO and RTO targets.

10. DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW AND DEVOPS: Design development processes including code management, automated testing, CI/CD pipelines, deployment strategies, and environment management from development through production.

11. TECHNOLOGY STACK RECOMMENDATIONS: Provide specific technology recommendations for each component including programming languages, frameworks, databases, message queues, monitoring tools, and cloud services with detailed justifications.

12. SCALABILITY PATTERNS AND LOAD BALANCING: Implement scalability patterns including horizontal scaling, load balancing strategies, circuit breakers, bulkhead patterns, and resource allocation optimization.

13. DATA GOVERNANCE AND COMPLIANCE: Address data privacy, retention policies, regulatory reporting, audit trails, and compliance monitoring systems to meet international financial regulations.

14. COST OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES: Implement cost optimization including resource right-sizing, auto-scaling policies, reserved capacity planning, and cost monitoring and alerting systems.

15. MIGRATION STRATEGY: Develop a comprehensive migration plan from legacy systems including phased migration approach, risk mitigation strategies, rollback procedures, and minimal business disruption.

Please provide detailed explanations for each component, explain design decisions and trade-offs considering factors such as performance, scalability, cost, complexity, and maintainability. Include specific technology recommendations with reasoning, architectural patterns, and best practices. Address how the architecture handles edge cases, failure scenarios, and evolving business requirements. Consider the human factors including development team structure, operational procedures, and knowledge transfer requirements.
