Design a scalable web application architecture for an e-commerce platform that needs to handle 10,000 concurrent users during peak shopping periods. Your architecture should include a detailed database design with proper normalization, effective caching strategies using Redis or Memcached, load balancers, CDN integration, payment processing systems, inventory management, user authentication and authorization, session management, and monitoring tools. Explain the key components, their interactions, data flow between services, and how the system maintains performance and reliability under high traffic loads while ensuring secure transactions.
