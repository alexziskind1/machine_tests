Write a comprehensive Python function that implements binary search on a sorted list with optimal time complexity. Your implementation should include proper error handling for edge cases like empty lists and invalid inputs, detailed docstrings explaining parameters and return values, type hints for better code documentation, and at least two practical example usage scenarios demonstrating different use cases. Also provide a brief explanation of the algorithm's time complexity and why binary search is more efficient than linear search for large sorted datasets. Ensure the code follows Python best practices and is production-ready.
