Debug this JavaScript code and provide a comprehensive explanation of what's wrong, why it's causing issues, and how to fix it. Also suggest best practices to prevent similar bugs in the future:

function calculateTotal(prices) {
    let total = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i <= prices.length; i++) {
        total += prices[i];
    }
    return total;
}

Explain the specific error, demonstrate the corrected version, provide test cases that would catch this bug, and discuss defensive programming techniques that could make this function more robust and maintainable in a production environment.
